=================================
## Description

This program is a fun way to spend your time while still being productive. Staying focused (and not procrastinating!) is hard. Focus Fun aims to make this process not only easier but more enjoyable.

Focus Fun implements the Pomodoro Focus techique. This technique suggests a period of 25 minutes working followed by a 5 minute break. This program helps you out by setting the times for the Pomodoro technique, so you don't have to do any work other than pressing "start"! This program also offers a fun game in the 5 minute intermission for you to destress. Worried about getting so caught up in the game that you forget to go back to work? No worries! The game automatically stops after 5 minutes.

This is just one of Focus Fun's cool features. The game also includes a health and experience bar. As you play the mini-games, you gain the experience you need to reach the next level. However, you also suffer damage from playing the game. The only way to recover is to let your player rest during a 25 minute work period!
